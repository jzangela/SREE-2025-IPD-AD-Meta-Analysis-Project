# SREE-2025-IPD-AD-Meta-Analysis-Project

This is a repository for the ES metric selection project. In this project, I illustrate and empirically evaluate statistical methods that combine IPD and AD in meta-analyses, with a particular focus on continuous outcomes in a social science context. For illustration, I use data from Zettersten et al. (2024), originally a meta-analysis examining infantsâ€™ preferences for adult-directed speech versus infant-directed speech. This meta-analysis synthesized aggregated data from a registered multi-lab replication alongside other primary studies. In the original analysis, effect size estimates for AD-based primary studies were reported at the age-group level, while the multi-lab replication provided IPD for each lab. Using this dataset, I expand the analytical framework by illustrating the procedure for conducting both one-stage and two-stage meta-analyses that integrate IPD and AD in terms of treatment effects or group means. I also discuss the statistical assumptions and considerations underlying different modeling approaches. Furthermore, I will compare the results of the one-stage modeling approach and the original two-stage approach to assess potential aggregation bias.

This repository contains a complete reference list for the current study.
